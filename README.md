# TriviaGame

### Overview

In this activity, I create a time NBA themed Trivia game using JavaScript and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The trivia game form only allows players to enter one answer per question. jQuery was used to create functions that kept score, kept time, and displayed a countdown of the clock. 


* This trivia game consists of 10 multiple choice questions about fun NBA facts.

* The player must finish the game before the clock runs out. 

* When the game ends, the page reveals the number of questions that the player answered correctly and incorrectly.
